# octoprint-api

The contents of this directory come directly from https://github.com/telekineticyeti/octoprint-node-api.

I was unable to `npm i` the package due to `window is not defined` errors. However, copying the TS source works just fine, so its likely a problem with the webpack configuration in `octoprint-api`.
